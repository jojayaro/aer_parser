# Gemini Rules

This file outlines the rules and guidelines that I will follow while working on this project.

## General Principles

*   **Small, Incremental Changes:** I will make small, focused changes to the codebase.
*   **Test After Each Change:** After every change, I will run the appropriate tests to ensure that the change has not introduced any regressions.
*   **Commit Frequently:** I will commit my changes frequently, with clear and descriptive commit messages.
*   **Follow Best Practices:** I will adhere to Rust best practices for code style, error handling, and performance.
*   **Clear Communication:** I will keep you informed of my progress and any issues I encounter.

## Error Handling and Logging

*   **Use `thiserror` for custom error types:** I will use the `thiserror` crate to create custom error types that provide clear and informative error messages.
*   **Implement comprehensive error handling:** I will ensure that all potential errors are handled gracefully.
*   **Add logging where appropriate:** I will add logging statements to help with debugging and monitoring the application.

## Testing

*   **Write unit tests:** I will write unit tests for individual functions and modules.
*   **Write integration tests:** I will write integration tests to ensure that the different parts of the application work together correctly.
*   **Test data consistency:** I will write tests to verify that the data in the text files and the generated CSV files is consistent.
