# Parser written in Rust for Alberta Energy Regulator ST1 and ST49 Reports (WIP)

Parser was originally written in Python [(Repo Link)](https://github.com/jojayaro/Exploration_App) but I decided to refactor it to Rust as part of learning process and to improve the code since the original implementation is not optimal.

Note this is a work in progress.
